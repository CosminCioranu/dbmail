DBmail extra's
==============

-	Dbmail can forward to external programs. 
	Create an alias. Set the deliver_to for that alias to:
	"|/usr/bin/procmail" will pipe the message for the alias to procmail
	"!/usr/bin/procmail" will do the same but add a mbox style header 

-	Conversion programs
	raw-convert.c -> reads mbox styled mailboxes and inserts them into DBmail
