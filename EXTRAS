DBmail extra's
==============

-	Dbmail can forward to external programs. 
	Create an alias. Set the deliver_to for that alias to:
	"|/usr/bin/procmail" will pipe the message for the alias to procmail
	"!/usr/bin/procmail" will do the same but add a mbox style header 
	You can also use this scan mail for certain users:
	"|/usr/bin/spamassasin | dbmail-smtp -d <username>"
	

-	Conversion programs
	raw-convert.c	->	reads mbox styled mailboxes and inserts them into DBmail
	smtp-convert.c	->	uses the dbmail-smtp program to insert mbox styled mailboxes
						into the DBmail system.
	
-	Conversion between mysql - pgsql
	See the mysql2pgsql dir
	We will also add software to convert from pgsql -> mysql
