2004-01-19 (Roel Rozendaal):
FETCH MSGNUM (RFC822.HEADER) returns headers in wrong order.

2004-03-24 (Aaron Stone):
The mime parser chokes on some messages, probably due to some
'\n'-'\r\n' mismatch

2004-05-06 (Ilja Booij):
Messages with only a header only get accepted when they have more
than 1 header line. If messages with only headers should get accepted,
they should probably also be accepted if they have only one line of
headers. In practice, this bug is not really a problem, but it
should be taken care of nonetheless.
