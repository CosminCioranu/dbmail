DBMAIL installation
===================

What do you need?

- working MYSQL
- working smtp server (preferrably Postfix)
- a little knowledge about SQL

1.	First you'll need to create the DBMAIL database in MYSQL.
	This is easy. You'll need the mysql commandline program for this. 
	Just do :
	
	mysql -u root -p <sql/create_tables.sql
	
	After this, the DBMAIL tables will be created.

2. Look at the config.h file in the dbmail source directory. You will see a few #define
	statements. First the #define HOST should contain the hostname of the 
	machine that runs the MYSQL database. USER and PASS need to be replaced
	with a user and password that can access the DBMAIL database. 

	Do a find or a locate for mysql.h. Copy this path and set it in the 
	dbmysql.h in the #include "full path to mysql.h"

	If you want verbose debugging you can set the TRACE_LEVEL to 4 or 5. 
	For normal messages the TRACE_LEVEL should be 2.

	You might check the location for the mysqlclient file (usually it's 
	in /usr/local/lib/mysql). If it is different you need to change this
	in the Makefile in the dbmail source directory.
	
3.	Run make 
	Everything should go ok. If not, it usually means that the compiler 
	can't find the mysqlclient library or the mysqlclient header file.
	After the make the following binaries should have been created:
	dbmail-smtp				- the dbmail mailinjector
	dbmail-pop3d			- the dbmail pop3 daemon
	dbmail-imapd			- the dbmail imap4r1 daemon
	dbamil-maintenance	- the dbmail maintenance tool
	dbmail-config			- the dbmail configuration program
	dbmail-adduser			- the dbmail user add program

4. Next you will need to create some users into the dbmail mailing sytem.
	Currently this can be done in two ways. One way is using the dbmail-adduser
	utility. The other way is doing it in the database itself. 
	To do it using the utility do the following:

	dbmail-adduser <username> <password> <clientid> <maxmail> [aliases]
	
	clientid can be left 0 (this is if you want certain mailadministrators administer 
	specific groups of mailusers). maxmail is the maximum number of bytes this user may
	have in his/her mailboxes. 0 is unlimited. 
	aliases are a number of aliases for this user. @domain are domain aliases.
	
	example: 
	./dbmail-adduser john secret 0 25000000 john@dude.org john@dude.net @net.com
	This will create a user john, with a password secret. It will set john's maillimit
	25 Mb and all mail for john@dude.org, john@dude.net and @net.com will be sent to john.

5.	
	Become root and copy dbmail-pop3d and dbmail-smtp to
	/usr/local/bin. 
	Do a chmod 700 for dbmail-maintenance, dbmail-config and dbmail-adduser and 
	chown these files to root:root. Then also cp them to /usr/local/bin
	Or you can run ./install.sh which does all this.

6. check your dbmail.conf file and set it to your likeings. After that you can 
	best copy it to the /etc/ directory and set it also chmod 700 for user root.

-- The next lines are MTA dependend, this is for postfix --
	
7.	In the master.cf file for postfix add the following:
	dbmail    unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
	    flags=  user=eelco:eelco argv=/usr/local/bin/dbmail-smtp -d ${recipient}

	and insert into the /etc/postfix/transport file 
	<domain>		dbmail:
	for all domains you want dbmail to be destiation for.
	Next run postmap /etc/postfix/transport
	Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the line 
	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

	do a postfix reload and if everything goes well 
	mail should be delivered to dbmail. If not, try running 
	postfix with the -v option to see what's going on. If the 
	problem seems to be in dbmail, try changing the tracelevel in debug.h
	to 4 or 5. This should give enough info. You need to recompile and 
	copy the dbmail- executables.

--  -----------------------------------------------------------

If you do not use postfix. The dbmail injector program, dbmail-smtp,
can receive information in two ways. Either through raw mail (for example, 
delivered by procmail) using the -n option or from a MTA with receipients 
in the commandline using the -d option.

Steven Kroon <steven@stevenkroon.com> suggested using fetchmail:

Your .fetchmailrc file should look like:

--
defaults        proto   pop3
			user "myusername"
			poll "your pop3 server"
			pass "mypasswd"
								 
mda "/usr/local/bin/dbmail-smtp -n to"
---


If u get dbmail running on other MTA's please tell me at
eelco@eelco.com.

For other problems you can subscribe to the dbmaillist. If you want to
subscribe, send a "subscribe dbmail" in the body of a message to 
majordomo@fastxs.net.
