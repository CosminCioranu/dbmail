DBMAIL-TIMSIEVED(8)
===================


NAME
----
dbmail-timsieved - receives messages from an MTA supporting the Lightweight Mail Transport Protocol, as specified in RFC 2033.

SYNOPSIS
--------
dbmail-timsieved [-f configfile] [-p pidfile] [-nvVh]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The dbmail-timsieved daemon will spawn child processes as specified in
the dbmail.conf file. These processes listen, by default, on port 2000
of the localhost interface. Mail Transfer Agents, MTA's such as Postfix
and Exim, speak LMTP to their Mail Delivery Agents which receive and
store messages. DBMail implements such a system using a database backend.

OPTIONS
-------
-p pidfile::
  Specify an alternate pid file. The daemons are currently hardcoded
  to use /var/run/dbmail-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt
  if the pid file cannot be written. Use the -p pidfile option to
  place the pid file in your system's preferred location.

-n::
  No daemonize. The program remains attached to the console from
  which it was started. This is quite useful for debugging when
  combined with the -v option.
