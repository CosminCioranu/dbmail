.SH "NAME"
dbmail-util \- maintains the integrity and cleanliness of the DBMail datatables\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
dbmail\-util [\-actubpds] [\-l time] [\-yn] [\-qvVh] [\-f configFile]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The dbmail\-util program does a global database cleanup and integrity check\&. All messages that are set for deletion will be marked for final deletion (status 3)\&. All message that are marked for final deletion will be cleared from the database\&. The integrity check will check for unconnected messageblocks, unconnected messages and unconnected mailboxes\&.
.sp
By default, the checks run in a read\-only mode, possibly prompting to make changes\&. Pass the \-n option to respond no to any prompts\&. Pass the \-y option to make read\-write changes, responding yes to any prompts\&.
.sp
As DBMail matures and new features are added, additional check modes will be added\&. In addition, more prompts may be added for different situations where changes need to be committed to the database\&. We recommend using the \-a option to run all checks and using the \-n and \-y options if you expect no prompts\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-a
.RS 4
Perform all checks listed below\&. This option will be kept up\-to\-date with additional checks available in future versions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
Clean up unlinked message entries\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
Test for message integrity\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u
.RS 4
Null message check\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b
.RS 4
Check and rebuild the body/header/envelope cache tables\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Purge messages with DELETE status\&. To purge messages currently marked \eDeleted, run with the \-pd options twice\&. This is not recommended; it is better to leave a grace period for old messages before permanently wiping them from the database\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Set DELETE status for messages flagged \eDeleted by IMAP or POP3\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s
.RS 4
Remove dangling/invalid aliases and forwards\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r time
.RS 4
Clear the reply cache used for autoreplies and Sieve vacations\&. The time is specified as <hours>h<minutes>m (don\(cqt include the angle brackets, though!)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l time
.RS 4
Clear the IP log used for IMAP/POP\-before\-SMTP\&. The time is specified as <hours>h<minutes>m (don\(cqt include the angle brackets, though!)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n
.RS 4
Show the intended repairs without making any changes, i\&.e\&. no to all\&.
.RE
.PP
\-y
.RS 4
Perform all repair actions , i\&.e\&. yes to all\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i
.RS 4
Enter an interactive user management console in some future version where this feature is implemented\&. It is not currently available\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-rehash
.RS 4
Rebuild the hash values for all the message parts in the database\&. You need to run this after modifying the hash_algorithm config option\&.
.RE
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f configfile
.RS 4
Specify an alternate config file\&. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system\(cqs preferred config file location\&. Debian is patched to have /etc/dbmail/dbmail\&.conf as the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout\&. Use two \-q\(cqs to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Operate verbosely\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v\(cqs for extra verbosity\&. Those which don\(cqt understand this convention won\(cqt complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.sp
Returns 3 when errors are found but could not be fixed due to failure, 2 when errors are found but \fI\-y\fR was not provided or \fI\-n\fR was provided, 1 when errors are found and fixed successfully, 0 when no errors are found\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
After upgrading from DBMail 2\&.0, run this command to populate the cache tables:
.sp
` dbmail\-util \-by`
.sp
To set all messages flagged \eDeleted to the DELETE status, and to permanently purge all messages previously set to DELETE status:
.sp
` dbmail\-util \-dpy`
.sp
To get a listing of the changes that would be performed for all actions:
.sp
` dbmail\-util \-an`
.sp
To remove all IP log entries more than three days old:
.sp
` dbmail\-util \-l 72h \-y`
.SH "BUGS"
