MySQL --> PostgreSQL conversion:

1. copy the data from mysql to temp files:
mysql -u <dbmailuser> [-p if needed] < copyfrommysql.sql

this will create some files in /tmp containing all data

2. create clean postgresql database and insert data
NOTE: THIS WILL DELETE ALL CURRENT DATA IN YOUR POSTGRESQL DBMAIL DATABASE

make sure you are user postgres ..
then issue the command:
./pgsql-convert.sh

this will drop the dbmail database, create it, load the mysql data into it
and finally create the sequences/indexes/constraints

3. remove the data from /tmp

good luck!
